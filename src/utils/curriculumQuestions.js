    question_text: "Which normal form strictly eliminates all partial functional dependencies on a composite candidate key?",
    options: ["Second Normal Form (2NF)", "First Normal Form (1NF)", "Third Normal Form (3NF)", "Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)"],
    correct_answer: "Second Normal Form (2NF)",
    cognitive_layer: "Concept Foundation & Syntax",
    explanation: "2NF requires the relation to be in 1NF and that every non-prime attribute is fully functionally dependent on every candidate key, eliminating partial dependencies."
  },
  {
    question_text: "Which of the following ACID transaction properties guarantees that once a transaction commits, its modifications persist even during a sudden power or system failure?",
    options: ["Durability", "Atomicity", "Consistency", "Isolation"],
    correct_answer: "Durability",
    cognitive_layer: "Concept Foundation & Syntax",
    explanation: "Durability ensures that the changes of a committed transaction survive system crashes and power failures, typically achieved via non-volatile Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)."
  },
  {
    question_text: "In a relational schema with relation R(A, B, C) and functional dependencies {A -> B, B -> C}, which normal form is violated by the transitive dependency A -> C?",

    correct_answer: "Third Normal Form (3NF)",
    cognitive_layer: "Diagnostic Debugging & Tracing",
    explanation: "3NF requires that for every functional dependency X -> Y, either X is a superkey or Y is a prime attribute. Transitive dependencies via non-prime attributes violate 3NF."
  },
  {
    question_text: "What is the primary difference between a clustered index and an unclustered (secondary) index in a relational database?",
    options: [
      "A clustered index determines the physical storage order of rows in the table (maximum 1 per table)",
      "A clustered index can be created on multiple non-primary key columns without sorting data",
      "An unclustered index stores the entire table row data directly within its leaf nodes",
      "Clustered indexes are slower for range queries than secondary hash indexes"
    ],
    correct_answer: "A clustered index determines the physical storage order of rows in the table (maximum 1 per table)",
    cognitive_layer: "Concept Foundation & Syntax",
    explanation: "A table can only have one clustered index because the data rows themselves are physically ordered on disk by the clustered index key."

    ],
    correct_answer: "Once it enters the Shrinking Phase (after releasing its first lock)",
    cognitive_layer: "Execution Dynamics & Flow",
    explanation: "The Two-Phase Locking protocol consists of a Growing Phase (locks may be acquired) and a Shrinking Phase (locks may only be released; no new locks can be acquired), guaranteeing conflict serializability."

    question_text: "What edge-case condition can occur if two concurrent transactions both hold shared locks on a row and each attempts to upgrade to an exclusive lock?",
    options: [
      "A Deadlock occurs, requiring the DBMS lock manager to abort and roll back one transaction",
      "The DBMS automatically merges both exclusive locks into a single atomic transaction",
      "The second transaction overrides the first transaction without notification",
      "The read operation succeeds and converts directly to dirty read status"
    ],
    correct_answer: "A Deadlock occurs, requiring the DBMS lock manager to abort and roll back one transaction",
    cognitive_layer: "Edge Cases & Trap Detection",
    explanation: "Each transaction waits for the other to release its shared lock before upgrading to exclusive, creating a circular wait cycle (deadlock) that requires DBMS deadlock resolution."

    question_text: "Which SQL constraint enforces referential integrity between two related tables in a relational database?",
    options: ["FOREIGN KEY ... REFERENCES", "CHECK constraint", "UNIQUE NOT NULL", "DEFAULT PRIMARY KEY"],
    correct_answer: "FOREIGN KEY ... REFERENCES",
    cognitive_layer: "Concept Foundation & Syntax",
    explanation: "A FOREIGN KEY ensures that a value in the child column must match an existing value in the parent referenced primary key column, enforcing referential integrity."
  },
  {
    question_text: "What is the key criterion that distinguishes Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) from Third Normal Form (3NF)?",
    options: [
      "In BCNF, for every functional dependency X -> Y, X must strictly be a Superkey (no exception for prime attributes)",
      "BCNF permits partial functional dependencies provided the determinant is numeric",

      "BCNF only applies to unindexed heap tables without foreign keys"
    ],
    correct_answer: "In BCNF, for every functional dependency X -> Y, X must strictly be a Superkey (no exception for prime attributes)",
    cognitive_layer: "Diagnostic Debugging & Tracing",
    explanation: "3NF allows X -> Y if Y is a prime attribute even if X is not a superkey. BCNF removes this relaxation: X must strictly be a superkey for every non-trivial dependency."
